In Dairy project I have created a Dairy which helped me when I was studying at school. 
It served as a helping tool where I could keep track of home tasks which have to be done and of my lessons schedule.

In checkers I have tried to create a simple checkers game using Canvas and custom views.

In dutyapp I was studying Firebase and Room Database and tried to implement "online" app, where my classmates could see, who is currently on duty in different classes,
who and how many times was already on duty and how many everyone has debts, that has to be "dutied" off. There you can create different accounts with registration, 
customize your profile, set three different localizations and change themes to night and day. Also in this project I was using such technologies as RecyclerView, 
Glide, SharedPreferencesThough this application still has to be polished.

In checkers I have tried to create a simple Hanoi towers game where you have to rearrange many rings between three sticks using Canvas and custom views.

In xyexperimental1 I have tried to create an app which allows to display different geometrical shapes using Canvas and custom views.
Though this application still has to be polished.

All projects where deeloped using Kotlin programming language. They were developed a long time ago and since then I have improved my developing skills.
