In Dairy project I have created a Dairy which helped me when I was studying at school.

In checkers I have tried to create a simple checkers game using Canvas and custom views.

In dutyapp I was studying Firebase and Room Database and tried to implement "online" app, where my classmates could see, who is currently on duty in different classes,
who and how many times was already on duty and how many everyone has debts, that has to be "dutied" off. There you can create different accounts with registration, 
customize your profile, set three different localizations and change themes to night and day. Also in this project I was using such technologies as RecyclerView, 
Glide, SharedPreferencesThough this application still has to be polished.

In checkers I have tried to create a simple Hanoi towers game where you have to rearrange many rings between three sticks using Canvas and custom views.
